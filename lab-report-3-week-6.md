## Lab Report 3  
**#1: Streamlining ssh Configuration ->**  
After opening the .ssh folder from the File Explorer into VScode, I wrote the following code:  
![Lab Report #3 CSE 15L Streamlining ssh Configuration Code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103283657/167768078-92c2fc98-89bb-44f5-8004-bc53e9936b56.png)     
  
Which resulted in the following output:

**#2: Setting up Github Access from ieng6**  
I stored the public ssh key in github, which looks like this:

**#3: Copy Whole Directory With scp -r**  
I copied my whole markdown-parser directory into my ieng6 account as seen here:

You can see that the directory appears in the ieng6 account:

This is what happens when I combine everything to copy the whole directory!:
